"""Draw The Double Wide's funnies as real newspaper comic strips.

Ganja writes each strip's script into the edition draft (title, byline, 3-4 panels with a scene and lines).
This turns every strip into one inked, hand-lettered strip image with the Codex image model (gpt-image-2,
same ChatGPT login the agents use), saves it under site/img/funnies/ and records the path in the draft.
Run after Ganja's job:  draw_funnies.py drafts/<date>.json   (then re-render). Safe to re-run: drawn strips are skipped.
